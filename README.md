**Memcore Cloud** is the English product name. **忆凡尘 / Yifanchen** remains the Chinese name and codename.

## Why People Use It

AI tools forget the small things that make work smooth: your preferred wording, project boundaries, old mistakes, useful fixes, and where a task left off. Memcore Cloud keeps that trail on your own machine so a new agent window does not have to start from zero.

It is not a hosted chat app and not a summary vault. It keeps source records, source refs, corrections, and work experience together so memory can point back to the original words.

## What You Get

- **Shared local memory for your AI tools**: Claude Desktop, Claude Code CLI, Codex, OpenClaw, Hermes, Cursor-style tools, and newer local agents can connect to the same memory base.
- **Receipts, not vibes**: remembered items keep source trails so you can check why something came back.
- **Original records stay original**: summaries can help navigation, but they do not replace saved source text.
- **Tool boundaries stay visible**: Claude Desktop and Claude Code CLI are treated separately; relay or official-login records are not silently mixed.
- **A safer first test**: capability check proves the local Skill/MCP path works without recalling real memory or returning raw excerpts.
- **Local discovery that stays quiet**: the local page can show which AI tools are present, which ones are ready for a safe capability check, and which ones need permission first.

## Paste This To Your Local Agent

If you use Codex, Claude Code CLI, OpenClaw, Hermes, or another local agent that can run terminal commands, paste this prompt into it:

```text
You are installing Memcore Cloud for me on this machine.
Repository: https://github.com/strmforge/memcore-cloud

Install and start Memcore Cloud. Then install Memcore Cloud Zhiyi as a standing memory rule for this agent, not just a one-time setup note. If this platform supports skills or custom instructions, add the Memcore Cloud Zhiyi skill/instruction. If this platform supports MCP, register the MCP tool named yifanchen-zhiyi at http://127.0.0.1:9851/mcp.

After setup, run only a safe capability check with zhiyi_recall:
{"query":"capability check","mode":"capability_check"}
Do not recall my real memory yet; do not recall my real memory until I ask.

Keep this rule active from now on. When my question depends on prior context, call zhiyi_recall before answering and use source refs or raw excerpts when available. Triggers include previous decisions, corrections, project boundaries, forgotten context, install/test/release status, and short follow-ups in ongoing work such as "next step", "what else", or "then what". If the skill is installed but zhiyi_recall is not available, tell me the MCP/tool connection is missing instead of guessing from memory.
```

Chinese prompt:

```text
你正在帮我在这台机器安装 Memcore Cloud（忆凡尘）。
仓库：https://github.com/strmforge/memcore-cloud

请安装并启动 Memcore Cloud。然后把 Memcore Cloud Zhiyi 安装成这个 agent 的长期记忆规则，不只是一次性安装说明。如果这个平台支持 skill 或自定义指令，请添加 Memcore Cloud Zhiyi skill/指令；如果这个平台支持 MCP，请注册名为 yifanchen-zhiyi 的 MCP 工具，地址是 http://127.0.0.1:9851/mcp。

安装完成后，只做一次安全能力检查：
{"query":"capability check","mode":"capability_check"}
先不要召回我的真实记忆。

以后请持续遵守这条规则。凡是我的问题依赖旧上下文，请先调用 zhiyi_recall，再结合 source_refs / raw_excerpt 回答。触发词包括：之前、定论、纠错、边界、忘了、安装/测试/发布状态，以及持续项目里的“下一步/接下来呢/还有吗/然后呢”。如果 skill 已安装但 zhiyi_recall 不可用，请告诉我 MCP/工具连接还没接上，不要凭印象猜。
```

The installer tries to add the workflow skill where skills are supported, then registers `yifanchen-zhiyi` MCP where the platform supports MCP. Installing a skill is a connection signal, not permission to read chat bodies.

## Quick Install

macOS / Linux:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strmforge/memcore-cloud/main/install.sh | bash
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strmforge/memcore-cloud/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

WSL is only for development or advanced testing. Normal Windows installs should
use the Windows PowerShell command above.

Then open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:9850
```

## Safe First Check

For install checks, do not use `/zhiyi` first. It may run real recall. Ask the client to call `zhiyi_recall` with:

```json
{"query":"capability check","mode":"capability_check"}
```

A good first result should include:

```text
read_only: true
recall_performed: false
raw_excerpt_returned: false
mcp_tools: ["zhiyi_recall"]
```

Only run real recall after you explicitly choose to test memory retrieval.

## What The Local Page Shows

Open `http://127.0.0.1:9850` to see:

- which AI tools are present on this machine;
- which ones can run a safe capability check;
- which ones need permission before deeper access;
- whether a tool looks recently used or has been quiet for a while;
- where new raw records are being stored.

This page is read-only for platform data by default. It does not write app config, parse chat bodies, or recall real memory just because a tool was found.
Finding a tool means Memcore Cloud saw an entry point. It does not mean the tool is connected, readable, or ready for memory import.

## What Makes It Different

- **Source-backed memory**: recall can carry `source_refs`, raw excerpts, library ids, and rank reasons.
- **Zhiyi and Xingce**: Zhiyi keeps preference and intent experience; Xingce keeps work experience and validation paths. Experience is not a skill library.
- **Organized local records**: new records are grouped by computer first, then by the AI tool that produced them, so a multi-device setup can stay understandable.
- **Claude is handled carefully**: Claude Desktop and Claude Code CLI can both connect, but they remain separate surfaces. Official, relay, and CLI-related records keep attribution boundaries.
- **Hermes can inspect sources itself**: Memcore Cloud can provide raw/source-ref pointers and observe native feedback, while Hermes-owned skill changes remain Hermes-owned.

## Current Release: 2026.6.3

2026.6.3 is the current published release of Memcore Cloud.

- Memcore Cloud Zhiyi prompt v4 is a standing memory rule, not a one-time setup note.
- Agents are told to call `zhiyi_recall` before answering prior-decision, correction, project-boundary, install/test/release status, and next-step questions.
- The README, Wiki, and local console copy prompt now teach the same install -> safe check -> memory-first workflow.
- Capability check remains read-only and no-recall.
- The macOS and native Windows install roots were verified at 2026.6.3 with user data preserved while installing prompt v4 into Codex and Claude Desktop skill locations.

See [RELEASE_NOTES_2026.6.3.md](RELEASE_NOTES_2026.6.3.md) for the current release, [UPDATE_HISTORY.md](UPDATE_HISTORY.md) for older highlights, and [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for lower-level changes.

## AI Tool Surfaces

- **Claude Desktop**: can use Memcore Cloud through local MCP / Desktop Extensions; source records stay behind explicit parsing authorization.
- **Claude Code CLI**: can use MCP while staying separate from Claude Desktop.
- **Codex**: can use the shared skill and MCP entry, and local sessions can become source-backed records.
- **OpenClaw**: can receive memory support through its normal local entry points.
- **Hermes**: can consume raw/source-ref pointers and produce native feedback without Memcore Cloud writing Hermes skills.
- **Other local AI tools**: can be recognized from local settings; safe checks come first, deeper access needs explicit permission.

## Uninstall

macOS / Linux:

```bash
~/.memcore-cloud/uninstall.sh
```

Windows:

```powershell

```

Uninstalling removes the app files only. Local data such as `memory/`, `raw/`, `zhiyi/`, and `config/` is kept.
